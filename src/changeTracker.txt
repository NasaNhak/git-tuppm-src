	-- If both fastFillStaff_ENABLE_maleOnly and fastFillStaff_ENABLE_femaleOnly are true together, fastFillStaff_ENABLE_maleOnly is higher priority
	fastFillStaff_ENABLE=false, --DEFAULT: false --Set to true and load into any mission/free roam to start filling up MB staff. Adds *both* male and female staff. If unit levels stop increasing, trigger checkpoint, return to ACC and go into mission/free roam again. Obviously this may make some missions unplayable.
	fastFillStaff_ENABLE_maleOnly=false, --DEFAULT: false --Randomizes all soldier face Ids to male and adds them for an all male MB.
	fastFillStaff_ENABLE_femaleOnly=false, --DEFAULT: false --Randomizes all soldier face Ids to female and adds them for an all female MB. Female face Id pool is quiet small so be ready for face and names disappointment


r69

r51

- Since a lot of options are now toggles, reverted certain UI message changes
- Option to start M1 with Avatar instead of Snake when playing a new game
- NewGame+ mode is now a setting(isNewGamePlusMode) that can be turned on
- Skip Heli Rides is now a setting(skipHeliRides)

r50
- Added a 'No Fulton Device' - while this makes the fulton disabling optional in a new game now, the player cannot switch from the 'No Fulton Device' to the Grade 1 Balloon Fulton mid-mission. Can switch to all other fultons just fine so a minor annoyance
- FIX for NG+ patch - some dev items not having lvl 1 unit requirement

r49
- Enabled route shuffle for soldiers - no more "armored soldier here, sniper there" mission runs

r48

- Shifts change for MB staff now on both MB and MBQF

- Fulton revenge is always maxed so instead of having enemies always shoot down fultons, added some controlled randomization to soldier alertness for fultons
- CHEAT mode - wormhole effect added back to warping
- Any hostages being carried will warp to your new location - use with caution cause falling through the floor will prove fatal in most cases. Does not work on soldiers
- With DEBUG mode on warping to user marker will not use wormhole effect
- All salute dialogue is under highNormal category - that means equal priority
- Adjustments to Helmet/NVG/Gasmask usage

r47
- Radio is now disabled if a cassette tape is playing - some game action noises are still too loud though but at least Miller/Ocelot shut up
- New Definitive Edition weapons enabled for enemy soldiers and MB Staff. For enemies only those weapons are assigned which are non broken when used
	Enemy soldiers:

		SHOTGUN: WEAPON_RASP_SB_SG_GOLD DLC Grade 3
		SHIELDS: Olive Drab, Gold, Silver, White
- Now to drop equip, aim the weapon and hold <FLASHLIGHT TOGGLE> to help gamepad users - a bit inconvenient but game recognizes only a select few masked keys and not the keyboard/gamepad buttons. Let's be honest here, you have to take out the weapon in order to drop it right. So what if Venom's Bionic Arm causes him to clumsily flip the light switch as well
- CHEAT Mode - wormhole effect no longer used during warping. This greatly improves things that I hadn't tried before - like warping while carrying somebody. Wormhole effect would cause that soldier/hostage to be dropped. Without wormhole effect, the carried person is warped with Snake as well
- CHEAT Mode - warping now happens to last placed marker instead of first placed marker, this makes moving about with warping much more easier
- DEBUG Mode - logs will only write to a file on Windows

r46 
- Debug Mode logs are now actually printed to a log file for better debugging :) - thanks tex!
- File IO by tinmantex
- Better logger calls
- Debug Mode - Logs can be enabled or disabled anywhere now - Enabling debug logs will create the folder 'TUPPM' inside the game folder and print logs to the folder as long as Debug Mode is enabled. To do this a CMD command is called from withing the game. Can somebody hack your PC by hooking into this call made by the game? Probably. Can somebody hack you PC anyways? Yes. Still, you've been warned
- When Debug Mode is enabled, Checkpoint and Restart options become available in the pause menu - trust me, this is more for me than the players. Restart the mission or better yet, quit to the title screen and continue to see the menu options restored
- NONE weapon slots can be equipped for ASSUALT, SHOTGUN, GRENADE LAUNCHER, HANDGUN and SMG at the sortie prep screen, OSP runs possible without the use of an OSP patch now - thanks to unknown123 for his research. WARNING! Do not play FOBs with these NONE slots - you have been warned
- Drop weapons and support weapons, hold <FLASHLIGHT TOGGLE> button to drop a weapon or support weapon. Default keyboard mapping is 'X'. For gamepad players, aim the weapon and hold the light toggle button to drop. Items cannot be dropped
- Keep weapons between free roam->mission and mission->free roam allowing for better OSP runs
- Enabled lots of chat dialogue that otherwise gets closed off due to certain story or revenge conditions
- Enabled salute dialogue that otherwise gets closed off due to certain story or revenge conditions
- FOB goal doors on MB are now unlocked
- BB posters may sometimes appear on MB command platform(15% chance) even after completing M43, livens the mood a little
- MBQF now has DD soldiers with different outfits even after capturing the SKULLS or somebody somebody
- Live weapons now available on MBQF - killing staff or support heli is not allowed of course
- MB and MBQF now have DD staff outfits randomized on checkpoint reloads as well to be in sync with vanilla MB Staff randomization
- Staff on MBQF is now randomized from entire staff pool instead of Security Team alone(vanilla game)
- Better random staff face handling for MBQF
- Female staff may appear on MBQF
- Finally applied the best way for enabling/disabling fulton support in the game while switching between Grade 1 Balloon Fulton and others
- When playing a new game, start M1 as Snake again, no more Avatar, am fed up with that guy
- Weather durations adjusted for longer sandstorms, rains, mist
- Adjusted random time for MB morale boost between 15 and 25 minutes of play
- Morale boost on visiting MBQF as well now
- Return to ACC option now available if game over at MB
- Pause menu abort option for MB/Zoo/MBQF changed to 'Return to ACC'. This allows players to shower and return to the ACC without calling in the heli, and it also allows for instant application of demon points based on the player's actions at the Zoo
- Activating cheat mode now removes damage and damage collision completely
- Removed High Speed Cam effect when teleporting using cheat mode

r45
- BUGFIX for no heli rides patch - even with the patch heli rides were missing when going to MB/Zoo/MBQF from ACC. This has been fixed now and the patch will restore MB heli rides correctly as well
- BUGFIX M25 now has heli gimmick correctly placed with mission start from ACC
- BUGFIX vehicles in free roam will no longer randomize again on loading checkpoints or coming from the title menu
- MB may now have between 2 and 18 female soldiers on a platform provided there are as many in the particular unit type
- Show announce log during loading with Debug Mode On. Plus Loading tips are not shown if Debug Mode is On
- M2 and M43 will no longer use all Assault and Handgun weapons available but only those that have been developed
- Fixed LZ rotation for all MB LZs, no more random facing directions
- Adjusted vehicle positions for every single LZ - no more exploding vehicle or heli
- Changed the way the heli gimmick is placed in free roam/missions. The heli is now available for ordering before a pullout occurs. Pullout is now smooth and follows the area leaving route for each LZ. Any commands given to the support heli will disable the pullout
- A checkpoint now fires as the gimmick heli departs after gameplay startup. This fixes the issue with Quiet having weird sniping points on checkpoint reloads. The issue would still be present if the player quickly goes to the title menu after a mission start and then continues
- Enabled gimmick heli drop for MB/Zoo/MBQF even with on foot start. In order to ensure buddies (Quiet and D-Dog) don't jump into the ocean, starting positions have been adjusted a little so the BuddyController can fire and spawn them correctly before the heli takes off
- The only remaining issue with heli gimmick is getting the doors to open up
- Soldiers are now in salute pos at MB command platform deck and roof helipads when starting on foot. They'll only salute when the player moves closer however
- Disabled animals auto marking till I figure out a better way to mark/unmark them. Currently implemented marking method does not increase the player's total mark count when animals are auto marked and with the "More Animals" mods, soldier markers start breaking
- Quiet's cell radio now starts correctly with on foot deployment to Med platform
- "Fulton air support withdrawn" message no longer appears when playing a New Game


r44
- Reinforce heli is now RED - strongest heli type in the game
- Added a DEBUG Print log mode - hold <DASH> and <RELOAD> in the ACC to enable debug logs - haven't implemented any debug logs yet however
- MB Morale Boost is now given based on actual game played time instead of in game time
- Increased MB morale boost MAX random amount
- Better weather randomness

r43
- BUGFIX - weapon varieties code crashing the game on MB when weapons not developed
- BUGFIX(somewhat of a) - vehicles should no longer spawn into the heli and destroy it when starting on foot. However they won't spawn in their vanilla game positions any longer so the downside is that players are gonna have to walk a bit. Some LZs may still have issues and sometimes vehicles may take a long fall and explode. Can fine tune, very boring work, will fine tune
- Added unique soldiers to free roam similar to Infinite Heaven's WildCard soldiers - males only. The map will be randomly populated with 16 unique soldiers
- Some code cleanup regarding revenge powers config
- All enemy abilities like notice, reflex, health, reload, grenades, fulton etc are now set to max (holdup excluded cause otherwise no soldier can be held up)
- Revenge blocking dispatch missions now appear immediately even after being used. In the vanilla game, a revenge type is blocked for 3 missions and the dispatch mission reappears on the 4th mission. Now they reappear immediately. This allows for better spamming of the dispatch missions if the player would like to do so
- Reverted back to Active Decoys as shock decoys may sometimes be advantageous
- Actual weapons randomization on Motherbase now
- Even more weapons randomization

r42
- BUGFIX - Had accidentally removed different DD Staff weapons, only assault rifles ended up being used
- BUGFIX - Shields work for DD Staff again
- Fixed Grade 1 Balloon fulton deployment cost to 0 GMP, again -_-

- Added all weapon varieties for DD Staff
- Cheat Mode - No more squatting in order to teleport(warping)
- Added High Speed Camera distortion effect during warping

r41

- BUGFIX - auto marking fixed on Zoo
- Total marked count correctly increases for sniper bosses(Quiet and SKULLS snipers) with each subsequent marking
- Weapons free at the Zoo
- Killing any animal at the Zoo increases demon points by 40,000. Accompanied with a jingle. Applies only when the player exits via heli
- Fultoning an animal at the Zoo resets demon points to zero. Accompanied with a jingle. Applies only when the player exits via heli
- MB Morale Boost now accompanied with a jingle
- Weapons free at MB - killing DD staff is still not allowed however - just looks and feels weird anyway
- D-Dog can follow the player all over MB
- Destroying support heli on MB/Zoo will result in game over. This is not, surprisingly, a vanilla game check anywhere except for maybe a few missions, and I have added it myself for MB/Zoo
- More female staff on platforms - randomized between 2 and 10, provided the player have as many in their ranks
- Since morale boost happens in-game now so new message is displayed

r36

- Fixed weather probabilities/durations randomization
- No more hitting SPACE to Continue after loading - turns out the game has much shorter load times than it would have the player believe
- Changed mine type to one that D-Dog can mark on the map - some mines are mission specific and are default type

r35
- Fixed LZ rotations for all start on foot LZs
- Support heli searchlight is now always on
- When starting from the ACC on foot, the support heli will be spawned overhead - this is just a gimmick. Report any weirdness for any ( missions/free roam/missions started from free roam ) with regards to starts/restarts/checkpoints
- When starting from the ACC on foot, Quiet and D-Dog now drop from the support heli that is spawned
- Side effects include not being able to use the support heli for 5 seconds after the player starts the mission - plus Pequod leaves violently as if he has to take a huge crapper back at Motherbase
- Mortars, Machineguns, Containers, AA Guns and Guardtowers now reset when starting a mission/changing locations - happy farming. They do not reset on checkpoint reloading however

r34

r32
- S+ and S++ MAX spawn chances fixed - now are 50% and 40% respectively

- Revenge blocking combat deployment missions complete instantly - the player can now spam and block all revenge types. To each their own style of play
- Armored vehicles in free roam will have random classes (Normal, Red, Gray - although I find Gray to be more of a bluish color but your opinion may differ XD) applied to them except for PF Jeeps and Trucks
- Total marking count now increases with auto marking for soldiers, vehicles and bosses. For Quiet and SKULLS Snipers, unlike vanilla game, *total* marking count will increase only once

r31

Wanted to put this in for a long while, didn't think it would be possible :)

    Mission 1 - Phantom Limbs has an override for this and enables fulton. This has been fixed.
    Mission 16 - Traitors Caravan - fixed

r07
closed- Updated sources to work with game version 1.0.7.0

r06
closed- Free roam - ARMORed soldiers now spawn! Yay! Also this change works with previous changes as well and as a result reinforcement soldiers in free roam are also ARMORed with random weapons - but the game is not very good at loading ARMORed soldiers in Afghanistan correctly, some ARMORed soldiers may appear without ARMOR but will behave as if they were equipped while some who look ARMORed are actually not.
closed- Guard posts and patrols have random weapons! :D
closed- Changed MISSILE carrying soldiers back to 4(vanilla) as free roam balance had drastically changed

r05

closed- If an ARMORed reinforcement soldier carries a SHIELD, he will carry a SHOTGUN with it! Be careful
closed- If an ARMORed reinforcement soldier carries a MISSILE, he will carry an MG with it
closed- Reinforcements now arrive along with very first helicopter/armored vehicle call
